# Secure Federated Learning Systems

## Description

The Secure Federated Learning Systems project aims to create federated learning systems that ensure data privacy and security while training models across distributed datasets. By leveraging federated learning techniques, this project seeks to enable collaborative model training without the need to share raw data, thereby preserving privacy and security.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Federated Learning:** Techniques for training models across decentralized data sources.
- **Data Privacy:** Methods to ensure data privacy and security during model training.
- **Distributed Learning:** Approaches to collaboratively train models on distributed datasets.

## Use Cases

- **Healthcare Data Analysis:** Enabling collaborative analysis of healthcare data without sharing sensitive patient information.
- **Financial Data Sharing:** Facilitating secure sharing and analysis of financial data across institutions.
- **Collaborative Research:** Supporting collaborative research by allowing multiple organizations to train models on shared data without compromising privacy.

## Components

### 1. Data Preparation

Prepare and preprocess data to ensure it is clean, consistent, and suitable for federated learning.

- **Data Sources:** Distributed datasets from multiple organizations.
- **Techniques Used:** Data cleaning, normalization, feature extraction.

### 2. Federated Learning Setup

Set up the federated learning environment, including the client and server configurations.

- **Techniques Used:** Federated learning frameworks.
- **Libraries/Tools:** TensorFlow Federated, PySyft.

### 3. Model Training

Train models across distributed datasets using federated learning techniques.

- **Techniques Used:** Federated averaging, secure aggregation.
- **Libraries/Tools:** TensorFlow Federated, PySyft.

### 4. Privacy and Security

Implement methods to ensure data privacy and security during model training.

- **Techniques Used:** Differential privacy, secure multi-party computation.
- **Libraries/Tools:** TensorFlow Privacy, PySyft.

### 5. Model Evaluation

Evaluate the performance of the trained models and assess their privacy and security.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or above
- Required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure_federated_learning.git
   cd secure_federated_learning
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
